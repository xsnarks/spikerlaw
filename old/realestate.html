     Real estate professionals, we are all bracing for the TRID implementation on October 3.  Though the new law will change how we conduct real estate transactions, this does not have to be a rough transition.  
     I have been studying these changes and developing a system to ensure the simplest transition possible.  In order to provide you and your clients with the smoothest transaction possible, please email me a request 
     for the "Real Estate Closing Information Form" at <b>spiker@spikerlaw.com</b>.  Should you wish to discuss the new guidelines and what this means for you and how real estate closings will be conducted in the future, 
     please contact me. I am more than happy to meet with you to discuss things we can all do the make the transition easier.
